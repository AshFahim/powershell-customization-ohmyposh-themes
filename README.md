# Hi!
If you are here probably you asked me about my terminal look and i porvided you this link. <br><br>
A lot of people asked me about my windows terminal (Powershell) looks and theme and how to customize it. Here i will try to give you a detailed description how you can customize your **PowerShell** but you can also use similar methode to your **Zshell** or any **Linux shell**. So let's get started.

<br>

## 1. Install Windows Terminal
First of all you need to install <span style="color:green">**Windows Terminal**</span>. You can download it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) or search it in **Microsoft Store**. It's built in windows 11. After you install it you can open it and you will see something like this:

## 2. Get PowerShell
Now you need to get  <span style="color:green">**PowerShell**</span>. You can download it from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) or search it in **Microsoft Store**. Now you will be able yo select it in **Windows Terminal**. You can do it by clicking on the down arrow in the top bar and select **PowerShell**. If you don't see it in the menu simple just restart it. Now you will see something like this:

<br>

Now go to your terminal setting and set **PowerShell** as you default shell. Also set **Windows Terminal** as your default terminal. You can do it by clicking on the down arrow in the top bar and select **Settings**. Now you will see something like this:

## 3. Font 
Now you need to install a font that will support all the icons and characters that we will use. I use <span style="color:green">**Cascadia Cove Nerd Font Complete**</span>. You can download it from [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
Download it and install. After installing restart your Terminal app and select **CascadiaCove NF** as your default font. You can do it by clicking on the down arrow in the top bar and select **Settings**. Now you will see something like this:

## 4. Install Oh My Posh

```powershell 
winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh
```
